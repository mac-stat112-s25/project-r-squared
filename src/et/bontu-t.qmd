**Article:** [Successful teamwork: A case study] (https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5007&context=ecuworks) from Edith Cowan University


This paper is a literature review on effective teamwork as well as a case study between two teams to compare attributes from the literature. The criteria for success identified were commitment to team success & shared goals, interdependence, interpersonal skills, open communication & positive feedback, appropriate team composition, and commitment to team processes, leadership & accountability. The team that was successful exhibited all attributes found, while the team that wasn't successful, ending in the group disbanding, exhibited faulty aspects of the attributes.
