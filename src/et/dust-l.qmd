**Article:** [A Guide to Working in Groups ](https://learningcenters.rutgers.edu/resources/guide-working-groups) from Rutgers Learning Center

This article lists the benefits of groupwork, how to effectively work in groups, instructions for successful groupwork, and other resources. The first section particularly includes some useful aspects of group/team work that I hadn't thought about before, such as being able to better understand or retain a concept after explaining it to someone else, stimulating creativity and sparking new ideas through discussion, and better understanding of how one performs through collaborative feedback.

In order to succeed in a group setting, the article advises members to drawn on their own strengths while helping balance out each other's weaknesses, becoming better in collaboration than a collective of individuals. I am familiar with the interpersonal skills the article lists, such as effective communication, negotiating tasks, and accommodating/resolving conflicts, through previous leadership experience, but I also really appreciate the insightso on process management such as having clear goals from the outset, setting ground rules for discussion/collaboration, and keeping good records both as an accountability tool and to make sure everyone knows the information and can reference them when necessary. 

The article also lists additional tools, sites and apps for different forms of group work, such as **MindMeister** for mind maps and **SlideRocket** for slide decks. It also lists other articles with more information!
